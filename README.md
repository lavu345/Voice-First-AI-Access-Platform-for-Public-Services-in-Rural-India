# Voice-First-AI-Access-Platform-for-Public-Services-in-Rural-India

Overview:

This project is a multilingual, voice-based AI assistant designed to help users easily access public service information such as government schemes, healthcare facilities, and educational resources. It allows users to speak in their local language and receive clear, step-by-step guidance in both text and voice format.
